In Order to create a SVN repository on your local system, follow the following steps in exact order.

Go to your desired path in system. I has chosen, C:\Users\iti.tyagi 
1. I created a folder which will contain my svn repository for future needs (means I will use this file path to checkout on my system)

- Create Folder my_repo , C:\Users\iti.tyagi\my_repo
- Right Click within this folder path and chose Tortoise SVN > Create repository here

The repository will be created with some default folders like : conf, db, hooks, locks..etc

Now we have to use this repository as source for SVN checkout

2. Choose relevant folder to check in (I created another folder at path C:\Users\iti.tyagi\SVN_Code

Right Click > SVN Checkout > URL of Repository will be C:\Users\iti.tyagi\my_repo

                            And Checkout Directory will be C:\Users\iti.tyagi\SVN_Code
                            
                            Checkout Depth > Fully recursive
                            Revision> Head
                            Click OK
                            
                            
BOOM now you have SVN update and commit working...

You can add files folder and commit and carry on like normal SVN connected to server.
